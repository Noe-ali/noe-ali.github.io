This used to be my daily driver as it was my first mechanical keyboard, I used it for both coding and playing, but now is my second option for coding and my main option for playing games.
I personally enjoy the typing sounds, I started to research abour how to imporve them, so ended modding the keyboard with foam and tape mods. No, not joking I literally put foam and tape under the pcb to avoid the hollow sound that this keyboard does and now it sound smooth.

The Switches are Zorro Black a linear type switches similar to gateron or cherry reds, I don't know much about the label, it seems to be an Ajazz Original or some chinese label, but they do the job and as I mentioned, it was my first mechanical keyboard, I was ignorant about this topic.
I completely fell in love with it's 75% layout and I would never ever have a bigger keyboard than this.
