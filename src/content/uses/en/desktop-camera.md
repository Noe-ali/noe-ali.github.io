I've been using this camera for almost a year; it was a present from my girlfriend when I told her I wanted to start streaming and recording videos. So, she gave me this camera to begin with. I don't think I'll need to replace it at the moment, as it really gets the job done for what I need.


It records at 1080p, Full HD resolution, with an incorporated microphone and light. The light isn't very bright, but it can be supplemented with other sources of lighting. I find it useful for calls and streaming, but I've never used it for recording. It also boasts a nice design, thanks to the integrated light.
Â 
Its only downfall is that it records only at 30 FPS, a point to improve and the main reason I might consider using another one for recording.
