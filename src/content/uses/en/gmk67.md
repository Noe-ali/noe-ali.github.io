This is my daily driver for programming and everything else, this keyboard was my most recent acquisition, and I'm in love with it. I bought it from [**KBDfans**](https://kbdfans.com/) and it was my first time buying from them, and I'm very satisfied with the product and the service.

The keyboard is pretty solid, but the package only included the main PCB and battery, I choose it for this reason in particular, I wanted to make my own keyboard with my own style and feel.
That's why I bought the keycaps and switches separately, I wanted to make my own custom keyboard.

The switches are the [**Gateron Pro Browns**](https://www.gateron.co/products/gateron-g-pro-3-0-switch-set?variant=40479582945369), which are tactile switches, and I'm very happy with them, they feel very smooth and the tactile bump is very noticeable, I'm very happy with them.

The keycaps are the [**GMK Olivia**](https://novelkeys.com/products/gmk-olivia-no3), which come in an elegant pink, white and black combination, I chose them because they are close to the aesthetic I want to achieve in the future with my setup, using a mix of white, black and pink details.
