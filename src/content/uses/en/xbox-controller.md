I have tried many controllers and game consoles along the way, but one of the most compatible ones is the Xbox Controller. More than a personal preference, this controller is highly compatible with most PC and console games. Its layout is standard for almost every game out there. I paired it with an 8BitDo adapter to play games on the Nintendo Switch, and its battery durability is enormous compared to other controllers.

I really like its color as it matches my PC case and keyboard. I recommend this controller to everyone who wants to play games on any platform
