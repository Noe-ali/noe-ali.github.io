I chose this Samsung monitor after the last one broke. I hope to upgrade to a better one in the future. The display is decent, and while the design is not one of my favorites, it gets the job done.

It features AMD technology for FreeSync and 75Hz, which is sufficient for my everyday activities such as coding and casual gaming. Additionally, it appears to be quite bright, which I appreciate. The monitor also comes with several USB ports and compatibility with VGA and HDMI.
