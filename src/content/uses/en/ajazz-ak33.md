This used to be my daily driver as it was my first mechanical keyboard, I used it for both coding and gaming, but now is my secondary choice for coding and my primary option for playing games.
I personally enjoy the typing sounds, I started researching how to imporve them. I ended up modding the keyboard with foam and tape, No joke. I literally put foam and tape under the PCB to eliminate the hollow sound that this keyboard had, and now it sounds much smoother.

The Switches are Zorro Black, which are linear switches similar to Gateron or Cherry Reds. I don't know much about the brand; it appears to be an Ajazz Original or some Chinese brand, but they get the job done. As I mentioned, it was my first mechanical keyboard, and I was ignorant about this topic back then.

I completely fell in love with its 75% layout and I would never consider using a bigger keyboard than this.
